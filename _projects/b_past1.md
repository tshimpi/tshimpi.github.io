At the Systems for Artificial Intelligence Lab at Georgia Tech, I developed a high-performance, containerized image preprocessing pipeline in PyTorch. Using Docker, I designed a system that deployed containers across remote nodes, enabling parallel preprocessing of large datasets and greatly enhancing processing speeds. This solution streamlined image handling for subsequent AI models, optimizing the workflow for large-scale image data. The project primarily utilized Python, PyTorch, and Docker for containerization and parallel processing.
