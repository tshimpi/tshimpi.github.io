As a research intern at Adobe’s Media Data Science and Research Labs, I identified class and saliency biases that impacted the performance of most state-of-the-art models in One Shot Segmentation (OSS). My work led to the introduction of a novel dataset, TOSS (Tiered OSS), which helps researchers develop unbiased models and improve segmentation accuracy. This research was published in NeurIPS’21 and later cited in ICLR 2024, underscoring its relevance and impact in the field.
