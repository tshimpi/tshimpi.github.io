At the Database group at Georgia Tech, I focused on enhancing the performance and memory efficiency of vector databases. This involved profiling the memory usage of state-of-the-art vector databases to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Currently, I am designing a scheme to leverage Compute Express Link (CXL) and disaggregated memory, which aims to expand the main memory available to the system and minimize disk access. This approach is intended to improve data access speeds and overall database performance. The project primarily uses Python, with PyTorch, Milvus, and Llama-index as core technologies.
