Proposed a method to structure unordered text documents by segmenting them into coherent sections based on keywords. Using the TextRank algorithm to extract keywords and Googleâ€™s Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) to compute sentence embeddings, grouped sentences into clusters centered around relevant keywords. Demonstrated that this clustering approach, which considers both sentence-keyword and inter-sentence similarities, significantly improves document coherence. Introduced two metrics, Sim1 and Sim2, to evaluate clustering performance, showing substantial gains over the baseline model in organizing unordered text documents into structured formats.
