      "answer": "I started out with research in AI, more specifically Computer Vision. I interned at Adobe Research and  worked on One Shot Image Segmentation. I also worked on Image Generation in my undergrad.\n Post my undergrad, I joined Cohesity, which is scale out block storage implemented in C++. My experience at Cohesity drew me towards low level programming and building distributed protocols from scratch.\n I am currently at Georgia Tech and I enjoy working towards optimizng vector databases and building systems for AI."

      "question": "What are you currently working on?",
      "answer": "I've been working on optimizing memory usage in vector databases. My idea is that if horizontal scaling of memory is the reason why distributed vector databases exist, then disaggregated memory solutions could be a possible answer. You can look for more details in my projects section."
