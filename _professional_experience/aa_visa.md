Worked on Visa's transaction authorization data pipeline

Broad Area of Work
===
Data pipeline testing and optimization for high-transaction environments.

Summary
===
At Visa, I was part of the Data Platform team, where my primary responsibility was to improve the reliability and resilience of Visa's transaction authorization pipeline, which handled 1.5 billion transactions daily. I designed and implemented an integration test suite that simulated various transaction scenarios, allowing the team to proactively detect and resolve issues before they impacted live operations. This test suite was a critical component in ensuring the accuracy and stability of one of Visa’s most essential data pipelines.

The project involved using Scala to build the test suite, alongside data handling tools like Kafka, Spark, and HDFS to process the large transaction volumes that Visa’s infrastructure managed. My experience at Visa equipped me with practical knowledge in high-throughput data systems and the importance of maintaining their efficiency and reliability.
