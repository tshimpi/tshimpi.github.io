Published novel work on One-Shot Image Segmentation at NeurIPS'21

Broad Area of Work
===
AI research in image segmentation and machine learning training bias.

Summary
===
As a research intern at Adobe’s Media Data Science and Research Labs, I conducted innovative research in one-shot image segmentation, focusing on identifying and addressing biases in machine learning models. My research pinpointed two key biases—class and saliency—that affected the accuracy of state-of-the-art segmentation models. By addressing these biases, I was able to enhance model performance by 4-5% across three leading models, establishing a new benchmark for future work in the field.

Additionally, I developed a novel dataset, Tiered OSS (TOSS), to help researchers evaluate model performance on diverse inputs. This dataset has become a valuable resource in the machine learning community, offering insight into model behavior across a range of scenarios. My work relied heavily on Python and PyTorch, which allowed me to build and test models within a research-driven environment effectively.
