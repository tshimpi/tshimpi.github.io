Revamped crash investigation and debugging workflows for all R&D

Broad Area of Work
===
System crash diagnostics, storage optimization, and authentication services in distributed file systems.

Summary
===
During my internship with the Distributed File System team at Cohesity, I focused on enhancing crash diagnostics, storage optimization, and authentication services for distributed systems. I designed a streamlined crash investigation process by incorporating breakpad minidumps, which reduced disk usage for crash data storage by 100x and allowed for more efficient crash analysis across R&D. My work contributed to a more sustainable and resource-effective infrastructure.

I also built a full-stack solution integrating Active Directory authentication into Cohesity's platform, streamlining the login process and improving security for clients. This project included developing a backend service with Golang and Typescript, as well as a user-friendly Angular UI. Additionally, I implemented a watcher notification service to monitor and notify administrators of configuration changes in Active Directory, providing real-time updates that improved system oversight and control. These projects provided significant hands-on experience with C++, Golang, Typescript, Angular, and debugging tools like GDB and Breakpad.
