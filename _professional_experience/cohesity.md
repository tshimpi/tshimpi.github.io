Led and built features for Cohesity's cloud and on-prem data management and security suite

Broad Area of Work
===
Microservice based cloud platform for data management and security control plane. 

Summary
===
At Cohesity, I contributed extensively to backend engineering efforts focused on enhancing data security, operational reliability, and management capabilities within Cohesityâ€™s enterprise infrastructure. I led the development of microservices that allowed for seamless monitoring of cluster health and the scheduling of upgrades, ensuring that infrastructure remained robust and secure over time. My work on backup verification included designing solutions to detect corruption in backup data by identifying anomalies in disk structures such as MBR and GPT, which helped in protecting critical data against loss.

Another key project was the Data Vault, where I built a data classification service to detect sensitive data leaks. This service utilized BigID scans to identify and manage sensitive information on disks, aligning with data compliance and security policies. I also spearheaded the development of an Entity Risk Score system that assessed user actions, providing an additional layer of security by monitoring potential insider threats. Throughout my tenure, I led initiatives to address and mitigate critical security vulnerabilities within the platform, contributing to a safer and more resilient product for our clients. My work at Cohesity involved extensive use of Golang, C++, and Python, and provided me with in-depth exposure to both backend system architecture and security protocols.
