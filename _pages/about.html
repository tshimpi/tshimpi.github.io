I am in my final year at Georgia Tech. I completed my undergrad from the Indian Institute of Technology IIT(BHU) in Varanasi majoring in Computer Science. I am working on vector databases and RAG pipelines to find out if there is money to be saved by running them smartly. I picked up the systems bug from my work at Cohesity and AI from my time at Adobe. Always open for a chat. 
Cheers!

I interned at Adobe Research and worked on One Shot Image Segmentation. I also worked on Image Generation in my undergrad.\n Post my undergrad, I joined Cohesity, which is scale out block storage implemented in C++. My experience at Cohesity drew me towards low level programming and building distributed protocols from scratch.\n I am currently at Georgia Tech and I enjoy working towards optimizng vector databases and building systems for AI." },

My idea is that if horizontal scaling of memory is the reason why distributed vector databases exist, then disaggregated memory solutions could be a possible answer. You can look for more details in my projects section." }
