I am in my final year at Georgia Tech. I completed my undergrad from the Indian Institute of Technology IIT(BHU) in Varanasi majoring in Computer Science. I am working on vector databases and RAG pipelines to find out if there is money to be saved by running them smartly. I picked up the systems bug from my work at Cohesity and AI from my time at Adobe. Always open for a chat. 
Cheers!
